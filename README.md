# React Learning Journey

This repository contains my React learning journey, including assignments and projects created while practicing React concepts. The focus is on building static pages, understanding basic syntax, and using both class and functional components.

  - Setting up a React project using Vite
  - Understanding project folder structure
  - Running the development server

- **React Basics**
  - JSX syntax and expressions
  - Creating **Functional Components**
  - Creating **Class Components**
  - Using props to pass data between components

- **Component Organization**
  - Splitting UI into smaller reusable components

## Assignments / Projects

### Assignment 3: Components Static Page

**What We Did:**  
- Created a static page using both **Functional Components** (`Header`, `Banner`, `NewProduct`) and **Class Components** (`Icon`, `Footer`)  
- Focused on JSX structure, without adding CSS/styling
