# React Assignment 5

## Overview
This is my **5th React Assignment**, where I practiced:

- Using **import/export** in React components.
- Working with **multiple multimedia files** including images, videos, and audio.
- Accessing data from a `data.json` file located in the **assets** folder.
- Using public folder for static assets.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of handling **external resources and modular component structure** in React.

3. **Using JSON Data**
   - Stored data in `data.json` in the `assets` folder.
   - Imported and displayed dynamic data in components using `.map()` function.
